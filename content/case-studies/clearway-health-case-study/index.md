{{< pink_heading text="Challenge"  sizes="bigger">}}
Clearway Health aimed to leverage the full power of AWS from the very beginning to ensure their SaaS was built on a robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure. Recognizing the importance of a solid foundation, they opted to use AWS RightStart by FivexL to build their infrastructure from scratch the right way.<br/> 
<br/>    
While creating the first AWS accounts and deploying the first application is relatively straightforward, scaling AWS infrastructure to handle more customer traffic, adapt to market changes, and meet compliance requirements is much more challenging. The complexity multiplies when the infrastructure lacks a solid, well-planned foundation.<br/> 
<br/>     
Clearway Health understood that to support their growth ambitions and ensure the success of their SaaS offerings, they needed an expertly crafted AWS environment that could seamlessly scale, adapt to their evolving needs, meet compliance requirements, and provide robust security for their data from day zero. They turned to FivexL, known for helping startups build infrastructure on AWS.

FivexL created a dedicated service called AWS RightStart for requests like these. The team has packed years of experience working with startups into this service, anticipating and addressing the challenges they face at the growth stage to set them up for success.  
  
AWS RightStart leverages the concept of an AWS Landing Zone, which includes a set of best practices and configurations to provide a robust, scalable, and secure multi-account AWS environment.  
  
Clearway Health received an infrastructure capable of supporting thousands of future users. Each foundational element is methodically constructed to ensure security and elasticity, providing a solid base that will be sufficient for years to come.
### Key Components Clearway Health received 
**Account Baseline Factory**  
This baseline setup is a key part of AWS RightStart, which allows the startup to maintain a secure and compliant environment without the overhead of configuring each account individually. All accounts come pre-configured with essential contacts (billing, security, operations) and have unused regions disabled for added protection. Additionally, other preconfigured features simplify the usage of accounts, such as OIDC for CI access, Terraform state management, and more. Security tooling is configured organization-wide, including AWS Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty, to ensure comprehensive auditing, security posture management, API call logging, and intrusion detection.<br/>   

**AWS Organization Management Account**  
FivexL implements Organizational Units (OUs) to group accounts with similar or related functions to apply common policies, share common resources, or provision and manage common resources.  

**Logs Archive Account**
All logs are replicated and stored in an immutable log storage setup, ensuring they cannot be altered or deleted, and no one has access by default.This is important for startups to ensure compliance and maintain a reliable audit trail.

**Security Tooling Account**  
This account features a centralized setup for CloudTrail, Security Hub, Config, and GuardDuty, ensuring organization-wide security monitoring and alerting. This centralized security management helps Clearway Health quickly detect and respond to potential threats across their entire AWS environment.    

**SSO Account**  
AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) is configured with an IDP provider, predefined permission sets, and Slack integration for temporary access, ensuring secure and efficient identity management. This setup simplifies access management ensuring that developers of the startup have the right level of access.

**Network Management Account**  
Shared VPC configurations are managed with public, private, and database subnets, enhancing security and segregation of workloads. 

**Encryption  Account**  
Multi-regional AWS KMS keys are created and set up in this dedicated account for centralized management. This ensures that the keys are managed by a dedicated team and are not accidentally deleted or modified. Restrictive key policies are implemented to prevent unauthorized modifications. 

**Backup Account**  
Clearway Health received pre-created backup accounts in production, development, and staging environments. This setup will help protect the startup's data against loss and ensure business continuity when it becomes necessary.


**Workload Accounts**  
These accounts are ready to accept workloads with ECS clusters and supporting resources pre-configured for different components (e.g., frontend, backend) based on the software architecture. It allows the startup to deploy their applications quickly and efficiently, focusing on growth and innovation.
