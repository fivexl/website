{{< md >}}
FivexL RightStart is a foundation for startups on AWS — a battle-tested way to launch with secure, scalable, and audit-ready infrastructure from day one. Instead of growing out of a single ad-hoc account into security gaps, compliance headaches (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA), surprise costs, and brittle manual processes that create technical debt, you start with the right building blocks: multi-account boundaries, least-privilege access, centralized logging, and cost controls—all as code. 

Built from years of work with successful teams in healthcare and fintech, RightStart applies AWS best practices so you can ship faster, pass audits sooner, and keep spend predictable as you scale.
