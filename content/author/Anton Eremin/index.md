As the lead developer of **FivexL's productized service: AWS RightStart**, Anton has contributed to creating a robust, scalable solution to establish secure and efficient AWS infrastructures for FivexL clients.

This solution enables startups to set up a secure, scalable AWS foundation with:
* Dedicated accounts using a multi-account strategy
* Centralized organization management with Control Tower
* Enhanced security through Centralized Security Tools
* Effective cost management
* Self-service account provisioning using GitOps and AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)  
  
Anton played a significant role in the FivexL development team on **the Terraform AWS SSO Elevator project**, making a notable contribution.
