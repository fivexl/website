### Recent Success Story  
Anton played a pivotal role in developing internal FivexL projects, which have since been successfully deployed across multiple client environments.

As the lead developer of **FivexL's productized service, AWS RightStart**, Anton contributed to the creation of a robust, scalable solution that establishes secure and efficient AWS infrastructures for FivexL clients.
[AWS RightStart by FivexL](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-d4lown4cemykw) is a Control Tower-based Landing Zone implemented as infrastructure-as-code using Terraform/OpenTofu. It offers advanced features for access management and governance at scale. This solution enables startups to set up a secure, scalable AWS foundation with:  

- Dedicated accounts using a multi-account strategy  
- Centralized organization management with Control Tower  
- Enhanced security through centralized security tools  
- Effective cost management  
- Self-service account provisioning using GitOps and AWS Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)  

### Open Source Contributions

Anton is the maintainer of most FivexL open-source projects and has made significant contributions to their development:

Anton played a key role in the development of the **Terraform AWS SSO Elevator** project.  
[The Terraform AWS SSO Elevator](https://github.com/fivexl/terraform-aws-sso-elevator) is an open-source module designed to implement temporary elevated access via the AWS IAM Identity Center (the successor to AWS Single Sign-On) and Slack.  
  
[Terraform-AWS-Cloudtrail-To-Slack](https://github.com/fivexl/terraform-aws-cloudtrail-to-slack): A module that parses AWS CloudTrail events and sends alerts to Slack for events matching pre-configured rules.  

[Terraform-AWS-Account-Baseline](https://github.com/fivexl/terraform-aws-account-baseline): An open-source Terraform module designed to provide a standardized foundational setup for AWS accounts.  

[Terraform-AWS-Slack-Alerts](https://github.com/fivexl/terraform-aws-slack-alerts): A module that configures AWS ChatBot workspaces and creates alerts for budgets, cost anomalies, GuardDuty findings, health events, and reservation/savings plan utilization. These alerts are sent to Slack for efficient monitoring.
