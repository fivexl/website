Aleksandr is a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer specializing in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), and Terraform, helping teams build scalable, reliable platforms with tight CI/CD and smart cost optimization.

### Specialization
AWS · Kubernetes (EKS) · Terraform/Terragrunt · Infrastructure as Code

### Recent success story
- Built and deployed AWS infrastructure from scratch with Terraform; later split a single-account cluster into multi-account (staging/production/infrastructure) with minimal downtime.
- Drove Infrastructure-as-Code adoption using Terraform/Terragrunt; refactored modules and introduced Terragrunt workflows.
- Migrated autoscaling from ASGs to Karpenter to improve efficiency and scaling responsiveness.
- Cut cloud spend with Reserved/Spot strategies and AZ-aware traffic for non-prod, while keeping reliability intact.
- Implemented end-to-end monitoring/logging and Slack alerting; deployed Prometheus/VictoriaMetrics-based stacks.
- Automated Vault snapshots and S3 backups via a reusable Terraform module.
- Wrote a custom block-height exporter for a blockchain network to improve operational insight.
- Dockerized legacy Vagrant setups and integrated acceptance tests into CI to speed releases and raise quality (prior QA automation lead).

### Education
Kyrgyz State Technical University named after I. Razzakov — Software Engineering of Computing and Automated Systems.

### Before FivexL
Before FivexL, Aleksandr set up and operated AWS-based systems, streamlined autoscaling, CI/CD, and monitoring. Earlier, he led QA automation.

### Personality
I'm an easy-going team player and constant learner. I like video games and I'm always exploring new tech.
