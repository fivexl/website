Infra Clinic is a monthly program for startups building on AWS.
Each month, we choose one startup and spend four weeks inside their real AWS environment – reviewing architecture, security, costs, and delivery, and helping implement the most important fixes.

It’s not a theoretical audit or a sales demo. **You get help of AWS certified 
cloud specialists**, plus our AI Infra Agent working alongside your team: answering questions, shaping your roadmap, and unblocking infra problems that slow product development.

Instead of a consulting fee, the selected startup makes a **€100–500 donation to Lastefond**, a foundation supporting seriously ill children in Estonia.

Every startup that applies – **whether selected or not** – gets a **free AWS discovery call** with tailored advice and a clearer view of their infra risks and priorities.

**Apply by the 20th of each month to be considered for the next Infra Clinic.**
