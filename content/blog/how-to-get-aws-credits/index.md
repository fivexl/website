## What AWS credits are

AWS credits are promotional funds AWS applies directly to your bill. They're not cash you can withdraw — they simply reduce what you owe for eligible AWS services until the credit balance runs out or the credits expire. In most cases, they cover core building blocks like compute (EC2, Lambda), storage (S3), databases (RDS, DynamoDB), analytics, and AI/ML usage. Some categories may be excluded (often AWS Marketplace purchases or certain support charges), so always check the terms for your specific credit type.

Startups use credits to get real work done before infrastructure costs become a constraint:

- Run an MVP (app hosting, APIs, storage)
- Spin up dev/staging environments without worrying about waste
- Process data (logs, ETL, warehouses)
- Test AI/ML ideas (inference, training, vector search, evaluation)
- Handle spikes (launch days, demos, campaigns)

One practical rule: set budgets and alerts on day one. Credits reduce the bill, but they don't stop spend from growing — they just hide it until later.

## Which track should you choose?

- **Choose Activate Founders** if your startup is self-funded (no approved accelerator/VC/provider affiliation).
- **Choose Activate Portfolio** if you're affiliated with an AWS Activate Provider (VC, accelerator, startup program) and you have their Org ID.

If you don't have an Org ID, you'll need to get it from your provider first (or apply via Founders if you're truly self-funded).

## AWS Activate credit tracks overview

| Track | Credit amount | Best for | Eligibility | Extra requirements | What you need |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Activate Founders** | $1,000 | Self-funded early-stage teams building an MVP | Pre–Series B, founded < 10 years, company website or profile | Self-funded/unfunded (pre-Seed → Series A). Use corporate email. No prior Activate Founders credits. ~$1k–$2k typical. | AWS Builder ID, Activate profile, company-domain email |
| **Activate Portfolio** | Up to $100,000 | VC/accelerator-backed startups with an Activate Provider | Pre–Series B, founded < 10 years, associated with Activate Provider | Approved provider affiliation; working AWS account; not raised > $100M; no prior Portfolio credits. Range: $5k–$100k. | AWS Builder ID + Provider Org ID + active AWS account (Paid tier) |

### Key notes

- Use a professional email for your Builder ID and application; it reduces approval friction.
- Credits are often incremental (you may request more in larger batches).
- Everything is governed by AWS Promotional Credit Terms.

### Non-negotiables

- Credits are generally tied to the AWS account they're issued to and can't be transferred outside permitted org sharing rules.
- They don't apply retroactively to past bills.

### Where to apply

Apply via the [AWS Activate page](https://aws.amazon.com/activate/). Sign in with your AWS Builder ID, complete your Activate profile, then submit either Founders or Portfolio (Portfolio requires your provider's Org ID).

## How to apply for AWS credits (step-by-step)

### Before you start (2-minute prep)

1. Decide which package you're applying for: Activate Founders (self-funded) or Portfolio (VC/accelerator/provider-backed).
2. Have your basics ready: startup name, website/profile, short description, funding stage, and your company-domain email.
3. Create (or confirm) your AWS account: you'll need an AWS account to receive and use credits, and a payment method is typically required to activate the account (usually not charged while credits cover usage).

### Step 1 — Create your AWS Builder ID

Create an [AWS Builder ID](https://profile.aws.amazon.com/). This is the identity AWS uses as the starting point for AWS Startups/Activate.

### Step 2 — Complete your AWS Activate profile

After Builder ID verification, complete your Activate profile (company details, stage, website/profile).

Be consistent: company name, domain, and website should match across your Activate profile, AWS account, and public presence.

### Step 3 — Choose the right package

- **Founders:** for self-funded startups.
- **Portfolio:** for startups affiliated with an Activate Provider (VC/accelerator/etc.).

### Step 4 — Link your AWS account (so credits can land somewhere)

Your application needs to be connected to the AWS account that will receive the credits.

If the AWS account is linked to the wrong Builder ID (common in teams), fix that before you submit.

### Step 5 — Submit the application (Founders vs Portfolio)

- **Founders includes:** startup details + website/profile + stage (self-funded) + confirmation you meet requirements.
- **Portfolio includes** everything above plus your Activate Provider's Org ID.

### Step 6 — After you submit

Watch for the decision email and verify credits in AWS Billing once approved.

## Approval timeline

AWS Activate credit applications are usually approved in 7–10 business days.

If AWS needs extra verification (or your Portfolio provider has to confirm something), it can take longer.

## When AWS Activate applications get rejected

Most rejections fall into a few predictable buckets:

### You don't meet the track requirements

- You're not eligible for the track you chose (e.g., Portfolio without valid provider affiliation).
- Your company doesn't meet baseline requirements (e.g., missing a real company presence).

### Your application doesn't look like a real startup profile

- No functional company website (or it's thin, broken, or doesn't clearly describe what you do).
- Missing or incomplete company details in the profile.

### Email and identity signals don't match

- You used a personal email (Gmail/Yahoo) instead of a company-domain email.
- Company name/domain/website differs across your profile, AWS account, and public presence.

### Credits history conflicts

- You've already received AWS Activate credits before (or received an equivalent/higher amount previously for that track).

### Portfolio-specific blockers

- Provider Org ID is missing or incorrect.
- AWS can't confirm your affiliation with the Activate Provider.

**Pre-submit safeguard:** company-domain email + working website + consistent company details + correct track + (Portfolio) correct Org ID.
