This is a test blog post created to verify how the RSS feed will appear in email notifications. The first 50 words (approximately 300 characters) from this content should appear in the email description, followed by an ellipsis.

## Why This Matters

When subscribers receive email updates about new blog posts, they should see a clean, concise preview that:

- Shows approximately 50 words of content
- Uses plain text formatting (no HTML tags)
- Properly escapes special characters like & and < and >
- Ends with an ellipsis (...) to indicate there's more content

## Testing Different Content

Here's some sample content with **bold text**, *italic text*, and [a link](https://fivexl.io/). The RSS feed should convert all of this to plain text.

### Lists to Test

Unordered list:
- First item with some text
- Second item with more details
- Third item to round things out

Numbered list:
1. Step one in the process
2. Step two with additional context
3. Step three to complete

## Special Characters Test

Testing characters that need XML escaping:
- Ampersand: Johnson & Johnson
- Less than: 5 < 10
- Greater than: 10 > 5
- Quotes: "Hello World"
- Apostrophe: Don't break this

## Conclusion

This test post helps verify that the RSS feed generates clean, properly escaped descriptions for email subscribers. After confirming everything works correctly, this post should be deleted.

**Remember:** This is a TEST post - DELETE after testing!
