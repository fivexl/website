## FivexL has reached a new milestone: we've become an AWS Advanced Partner!
### What is this?
AWS provides tiers (Select, Advanced, Premier) to recognize organizations that have proven technical expertise and demonstrated customer experience.  
According to [AWS program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/services-tiers/), "**AWS Advanced Tier Services Partners** are partners with a strong team of trained and certified technical individuals, and have proven customer experience."
### What does this mean for us?
This is a special achievement because we've chosen to be a small, agile team of professionals. It shows that even a small company can make a big impact.
Getting this status means we've met AWS strict criteria for deep experience in implementing solutions on AWS and having a highly skilled team of certified cloud engineers.  
### Real-World Experience and Continuous Learning  
Almost for five years, we've helped startups in Scandinavia and the US build infrastructure on AWS. We love assisting innovative services to meet their customers - check out [our case studies](https://fivexl.io/case-studies/). During this time, we are continuously learning to stay on the cutting edge of fast-evolving cloud technologies, passing exams, and getting certified.
